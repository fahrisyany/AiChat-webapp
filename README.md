<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Tout Regarder is a Web App focusing on searching movies at your own leisure and bookmark them so you can revisit later.

Main Features:
* All The movie catalogue available along with the details
* Bookmark your movie

Of course, this web app is incomplete and also full of potential use case. So I'll be adding more feature in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I used and find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
